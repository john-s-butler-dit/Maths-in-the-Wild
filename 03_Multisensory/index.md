This workshop dives into the maths and
neuroscience behind how we combine our
multiple senses, such as sight and
balance, for walking or even make a quick

The brain uses a combination of sensory inputs, visual (sight), auditory (sound), proprioception (muscles and joints), and vestibular (velocity and acceleration), to perceive self-motion.
The box on the lower right shows the location of the vestibular system, which is found in the inner ear (Campos et al 2020).
